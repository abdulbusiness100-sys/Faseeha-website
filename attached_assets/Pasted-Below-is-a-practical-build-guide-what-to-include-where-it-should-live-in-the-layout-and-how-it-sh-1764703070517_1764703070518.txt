Below is a practical build guide: what to include, where it should live in the layout, and how it should differ from your current Faseeha site, all geared to maximising organic visibility and conversion.

I’ll assume a similar overall structure to your current site:

Home (/)
Qur’an Programme (/quran-programme)
Arabic Programme (/arabic-programme)
Pricing/Enrol (/pricing)
About
Testimonials / Results
FAQ
(Optional later: Blog)
1. Global decisions that should go into your codebase
1.1 <head> section for every page
What to include and where

In your main layout component (e.g. Layout.jsx or inside each page if using Next.js app router):

html
Copy
<head>
  <title>Online Quran & Arabic Classes for Women | Faseeha Institute</title>
  <meta name="description"
        content="Faseeha Institute offers online Quran and Arabic programmes for women with native Arab female teachers. Learn tajweed, hifdh and Arabic from anywhere in the world." />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
  <meta name="robots" content="index,follow" />
  <link rel="canonical" href="https://www.faseehainstitute.com/" />
  <!-- Open Graph for IG/TikTok shares -->
  <meta property="og:title" content="Online Quran & Arabic Classes for Women | Faseeha Institute" />
  <meta property="og:description"
        content="Structured online Quran & Arabic programmes for sisters, taught by native Arab female teachers." />
  <meta property="og:type" content="website" />
  <meta property="og:url" content="https://www.faseehainstitute.com/" />
  <meta property="og:image" content="URL_TO_HERO_IMAGE.jpg" />
</head>
Key improvements vs current site

Your current meta titles/descriptions are quite generic.
Above, we front‑load the main keyword: “online Quran & Arabic classes for women” and “native Arab female teachers”.
For each page, adjust title, description, and canonical to target one main search intent (examples in later sections).
2. Home page: what to change and exactly where
Think of Home as a landing page for first‑time visitors from Google or socials. The current home is visually nice but not explicit enough about what you offer and for whom.

2.1 Hero section (<header> at top of page)
Where in code: First section in index.jsx or Home component.

What to include:

jsx
Copy
<section id="hero" className="...">
  <h1>Online Qur’an & Arabic Programmes for Women</h1>
  <p>
    Faseeha Institute is a women-only online institute with native Arab female teachers,
    structured levels and personalised goals — so you can recite, memorise and
    understand the Qur’an with confidence.
  </p>
  <div className="hero-ctas">
    <a href="/quran-programme" className="btn-primary">Explore Qur’an Programme</a>
    <a href="/arabic-programme" className="btn-secondary">Explore Arabic Programme</a>
  </div>
  <p className="hero-reassurance">
    Serving sisters worldwide · All time zones · From complete beginners to advanced students
  </p>
</section>
SEO / conversion improvements vs current

Current hero is more aesthetic but doesn’t clearly say “online Quran & Arabic classes for women” in the main H1.
This revised hero uses your main keyword in the H1 and first paragraph, which is crucial for ranking.
Reassurance line adds “all time zones” and “women‑only”, mirroring FAQ questions people actually Google.
2.2 “Who this is for” section (directly under hero)
Where: <section id="who-for"> right after hero.

What to include:

Three cards with explicit benefit‑led copy:

Card 1 – “Starting from zero”
Card 2 – “Improving tajweed & fluency”
Card 3 – “Learning Arabic to understand the Qur’an”
Example:

jsx
Copy
<section id="who-for">
  <h2>Who We Serve</h2>
  <div className="grid">
    <article>
      <h3>Complete Beginners</h3>
      <p>Start from the Arabic alphabet and basic Qur’an reading in a calm, shame‑free environment designed for adult sisters.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>Sisters Improving Tajweed & Fluency</h3>
      <p>Fix long‑standing mistakes, build smooth Qur’an recitation and work towards confident daily reading.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>Women Learning Arabic for the Qur’an</h3>
      <p>Follow a clear 4‑level Arabic curriculum that takes you from letters to reading stories of the Prophets in Arabic.</p>
    </article>
  </div>
</section>
Improvement

Your current homepage jumps into copy about “programmes” but doesn’t segment visitors.
This section answers “Is this for someone like me?” – which reduces bounce and improves conversions, helping SEO indirectly.
2.3 “Our Programmes” overview section
Where: After “Who We Serve”.

Two large cards linking to dedicated pages.

jsx
Copy
<section id="programmes">
  <h2>Our Online Programmes</h2>

  <div className="grid">
    <article>
      <h3>Qur’an Programme</h3>
      <p>
        Flexible online Qur’an classes for women covering tajweed, reading fluency and hifdh / revision.

      </p>
      <ul>

      </ul>
      <a href="/quran-programme" className="text-link">View Qur’an Programme →</a>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Arabic Programme</h3>
      <p>
        A 4‑level Arabic course for sisters that starts from absolute foundations and builds to reading
        stories of the Prophets in Arabic with understanding.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Level 1 – Alphabet, reading & pronunciation</li>
        <li>Level 2 – Core everyday & worship language</li>
        <li>Level 3 – Stories of the Prophets</li>
        <li>Level 4 – (Qur’anic Texts / Advanced, if you have it)</li>
      </ul>
      <a href="/arabic-programme" className="text-link">View Arabic Programme →</a>
    </article>
  </div>
</section>
Improvement

Compared to the current site, you’re tying each card to clear SEO phrases (“online Qur’an classes for women”, “Arabic course for sisters”, levels, etc.).
This also clarifies structure for Google’s understanding of your content.
2.4 “How it works” process
Where: Middle of the home page, after programmes.

jsx
Copy
<section id="how-it-works">
  <h2>How Learning with Faseeha Works</h2>
  <ol className="steps">
    <li>
      <h3>1. Enrol Online</h3>
      <p>Choose the Qur’an or Arabic programme and submit your details. We accommodate all time zones.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>2. Assessment Lesson</h3>
      <p>Your female teacher assesses your current level and clarifies your Qur’an or Arabic goals.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>3. Personalised Plan</h3>
      <p>We agree on a schedule, quarterly goals and whether you’ll focus on tajweed, fluency, hifdh or Arabic levels.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>4. Ongoing Support & Tracking</h3>
      <p>Track your progress via shared tracker and regular check‑ins on Slack/WhatsApp.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</section>
Improvement

Competitor sites that rank well all have a “how it works” section (Riwaq and Hidayah).
Your current site under‑explains the flow; this addition addresses a big conversion blocker.
2.5 Social proof on Home
Where: After “How it works”.

Include at least:

A headline that uses your keyword + “testimonials”
3–6 quotes, each tagged with programme type.
jsx
Copy
<section id="testimonials-preview">
  <h2>What Our Students Say</h2>
  <div className="grid">
    <figure>
      <blockquote>“I started not knowing the Arabic letters. Within months I could read the Mushaf and I’m now memorising Juz ‘Amma.”</blockquote>
      <figcaption>Qur’an Foundations Student</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <!-- more -->
  </div>
  <a href="/testimonials" className="text-link">Read more student stories →</a>
</section>
Improvement

You already have strong testimonials (from your screenshots – these documents can only be used in code execution).
What’s missing is pulling them onto the home page with keyworded headings to help search queries like “Faseeha Institute reviews”.
2.6 FAQ snippet on Home
Where: Near the bottom, before final CTA.

jsx
Copy
<section id="faq-preview">
  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <details>
    <summary>Do you offer trial lessons?</summary>
    <p>No, we don’t offer trials. Instead, your first lesson is a full assessment where your teacher evaluates your level, sets goals with you and explains how the programme will work.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Do you accommodate all time zones?</summary>
    <p>Yes. We have students across the UK, Europe, GCC and North America. We schedule lessons in your local time, including mornings and evenings where possible.</p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Are all teachers native Arabs and female?</summary>
    <p>Yes. Every teacher is a native Arabic‑speaking woman, trained in tajweed and/or Arabic teaching.</p>
  </details>
  <a href="/faq" className="text-link">View all FAQs →</a>
</section>
Improvement

You already know these FAQ answers; having them exposed on the page in HTML <details> gives you rich keyword content and is favoured for featured snippet chances.
2.7 Final CTA banner
Where: Very bottom of Home.

jsx
Copy
<section id="final-cta">
  <h2>Ready to start your Qur’an or Arabic journey?</h2>
  <p>Join women from around the world learning Qur’an and Arabic with native Arab female teachers.</p>
  <a href="/pricing" className="btn-primary">Enrol Now</a>
</section>
3. Qur’an Programme page: content + placement changes
Your current Qur’an page gives some info but doesn’t make the three focus areas obvious or keyword‑rich.

3.1 Page head (<title> etc.)
In /quran-programme page:

html
Copy
<title>Online Quran Classes for Women – Tajweed, Fluency & Hifdh | Faseeha Institute</title>
<meta name="description"
      content="Women-only online Quran classes focusing on tajweed, reading fluency and hifdh. Native Arab female teachers, personalised goals and progress tracking." />
<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.faseehainstitute.com/quran-programme" />
<h1>Online Qur’an Programme for Women</h1>
3.2 Sticky summary at top
Where: Top of the page content.

jsx
Copy
<section>
  <p className="eyebrow">Women-only · Native Arab teachers · All levels</p>
  <h1>Online Qur’an Programme for Women</h1>
  <p>
    Choose between tajweed, reading fluency and hifdh – or combine them in a personalised online Qur’an plan.
    Designed specifically for sisters who want structured, gentle but accountable learning.
  </p>
  <a href="/pricing" className="btn-primary">Enrol in Qur’an Programme</a>
</section>
3.3 Three focus‑area sections
Where: Immediately after the intro, each as its own <section> with an <h2> including the keyword.

jsx
Copy
<section id="tajweed">
  <h2>Tajweed: Qur’anic Reading Mastery</h2>
  <p>For sisters who want to learn to read the Qur’an correctly from the Mushaf, starting from their current level.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Master makharij and sifaat of every letter.</li>
    <li>Learn rules of noon saakinah, meem saakinah, madd, qalqalah and stopping/starting.</li>
    <li>Practise directly from the Qur’an each lesson with live correction.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="fluency">
  <h2>Reading Fluency Programme</h2>
  <p>For women who can already read but want smoother, more confident Qur’an recitation.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Increase speed and accuracy without losing tajweed.</li>
    <li>Build confidence reading longer passages.</li>
    <li>Weekly reading targets and feedback on specific mistakes.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="hifdh">
  <h2>Hifdh & Revision for Sisters</h2>
  <p>For sisters who are starting or restarting Qur’an memorisation, with realistic, sustainable goals.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Personalised hifdh plan (Juz ‘Amma, selected surahs or full Qur’an).</li>
    <li>Structured daily revision routine and weekly tests.</li>
    <li>Light tafseer and meaning to support recall.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
Improvement

This structure makes each programme linkable and indexable. You can have internal links like /quran-programme#hifdh from other pages.
The headings explicitly match queries like “tajweed classes for sisters”, “hifdh for ladies”.
3.4 Measurement & tracking section
Where: After the three focus areas.

jsx
Copy
<section id="tracking">
  <h2>How We Track Your Qur’an Progress</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Initial assessment in your first lesson.</li>
    <li>Quarterly personalised Qur’an goals.</li>
    <li>Shared online progress tracker updated each lesson.</li>
    <li>Slack or WhatsApp check-ins between classes for accountability.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
This communicates a differentiator most competitors don’t emphasize.

3.5 Programme FAQs (Qur’an‑specific)
Place a dedicated FAQ section at the bottom of this page, separate from general FAQ.

4. Arabic Programme page: content + placement
4.1 Page head
html
Copy
<title>Online Arabic Course for Women – 4 Levels | Faseeha Institute</title>
<meta name="description"
      content="Women-only online Arabic programme with 4 levels. Start from the alphabet and progress to reading stories of the Prophets in Arabic. Native Arab female teachers." />
<h1>Online Arabic Programme for Women</h1>
4.2 Level roadmap section
Where: after intro paragraph.

jsx
Copy
<section id="levels">
  <h2>A 4‑Level Arabic Course Built for Sisters</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Level 1 – Absolute Foundations</h3>
      <p>Learn the Arabic letters, reading and correct pronunciation. Build your first 100+ words and form simple sentences.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Level 2 – Core Arabic</h3>
      <p>Talk about family, daily routine, time, weather, health and worship. Read short ayaat and hadith that use your vocabulary.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Level 3 – Stories of the Prophets</h3>
      <p>Study adapted stories of the Prophets in Arabic. Focus on vocabulary, comprehension and reading fluency.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Level 4 – [Your Advanced Level]</h3>
      <p>Describe here: e.g., Qur’anic texts, more complex grammar, discussion‑based lessons.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</section>
Improvement

Current site content for Level 2 is wordy and not clearly grouped; here we compress it into SEO‑rich but scannable bullets.
Each <h3> contains both “Level X” and a meaningful phrase that can appear in SERPs.
4.3 Speaking from day one + Qur’an connection
Add a dedicated section:

jsx
Copy
<section id="speaking">
  <h2>Arabic You Can Use and Connect to the Qur’an</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Speaking practice starts from your first lesson, even in Level 1.</li>
    <li>We draw vocabulary from both everyday life and Qur’anic texts.</li>
    <li>Short Qur’anic ayaat and hadith are integrated as you progress.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
This answers “Is this just grammar?” and matches queries like “Quranic Arabic course online”.

5. Pricing / Enrol page: clarity + keyword use
5.1 Page head
html
Copy
<title>Pricing & Enrolment – Online Quran & Arabic Classes for Women | Faseeha Institute</title>
<meta name="description"
      content="View Faseeha Institute's pricing for online Quran and Arabic programmes for women. Choose your plan and enrol in women-only classes with native Arab teachers." />
<h1>Pricing & Enrolment</h1>
5.2 Plans layout
Where: Immediately after H1.

Use cards and label by outcome rather than just minutes.

Example:

jsx
Copy
<section id="plans">
  <h2>Choose Your Plan</h2>
  <p>All plans include women-only classes with native Arab teachers, progress tracking and flexible scheduling across time zones.</p>

  <div className="grid">
    <article>
      <h3>Foundations Plan</h3>
      <p>Best for complete beginners building reading or Level 1 Arabic.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 lessons per week</li>
        <li>45 minutes each</li>
        <li>Qur’an or Arabic</li>
      </ul>
      <a href="YOUR_WIX_CHECKOUT_URL" className="btn-primary">Enrol in Foundations</a>
    </article>
    <!-- Other plans -->
  </div>
</section>
Improvement

Use section heading like “Pricing for Online Quran & Arabic Classes for Women” so the page can rank for “pricing” queries.
Keep the external Wix checkout link but clearly label it so users feel safe.
6. About page: trust + E‑E‑A‑T
Google increasingly cares about experience, expertise, authoritativeness, trust. Your About page can serve this.

6.1 What to include and where
Top:
H1: About Faseeha Institute
Short paragraph explaining mission.
Middle sections:
“Our Story” – how/why the founder started a women‑only institute.
“Our Teaching Philosophy” – mercy, structure, accountability.
“Our Teachers” – bullet text about being native Arabs, vetted, etc.
“Our Students” – countries, number of lessons.
7. FAQ page: structure that helps SEO
Organise by category and repeat the core keywords naturally.

Example outline:

Learning & Levels
Scheduling & Time Zones
Teachers
Pricing & Admin
Technical Setup
Use <h2> for categories and <h3> for questions.

8. Technical & structural SEO notes for your build
URL structure – keep it clean:
/quran-programme
/arabic-programme
/pricing
/about
/testimonials
/faq
Navigation (header & footer)
Make sure the main nav links to all key pages so search engines see them as important.
In the footer, add textual links with keywords, e.g. Online Qur’an classes for women, Arabic course for sisters (linking to respective pages).
Internal linking in content
From blog posts and FAQs, link phrases like “online Quran classes for women” to /quran-programme.
Link “Arabic course for women” etc. to /arabic-programme.
Image alt attributes
Use descriptive alt text that still reads naturally, leveraging the photos you uploaded.
Example: alt="Muslim woman studying Quran online with notebook and laptop".
Schema (optional but useful)
Later you can add basic Organization schema in <script type="application/ld+json"> with name, URL, social profiles.
9. Concrete “from current site to improved site” summary
Problems on current site (from an SEO/UX perspective)

Hero and headings are not explicit enough about “online Quran & Arabic classes for women”.
Programme pages use nice copy but not structured for search (no clear sections for each track/level with their own headings).
Pricing/enrol journey is slightly unclear and not strongly keyworded.
Social proof and success stories exist but aren’t centralised and surfaced on high‑traffic pages.
FAQs are less visible and not leveraging all the questions you told me students actually ask.
Improvements you should implement while coding

Replace home H1 with an explicit, keyword‑rich value proposition.
Introduce “Who we serve”, “Our programmes”, “How it works”, and FAQ preview sections on Home exactly as shown.
Split Qur’an and Arabic pages into well‑labelled <section> blocks using the headings and bullet structures above.
Re‑write meta titles/descriptions to target one primary keyword per page.
Move your best testimonials into a dedicated page and preview blocks on Home and Programme pages.
Make sure every image has alt text, every important page is linked in header/footer, and internal links use meaningful anchor text.
